This package provides Medidata.Specrun.Reporting.exe, which should be called with the name of the test project executed
as the single argument. It should be called while in the same directory as the Specrun default HTML report. It will attempt
to find the most recent Specrun HTML file, based on the project name argument and the SpecrunReportFileSuffix config entry.
The package will produce two output files: an NUnit-compliant XML file, and an NUnit console output text file.
